                <div class="fans_text">Wow, that was one of the most embarrassing games in Laker history. Time for big changes across the board. This is not who the Lakers are. Have never seen Bron this tired, he needs to sit out and give the youngsters a chance to develop some continuity. Hopefully Vogel can right this ship before a crash.</div>

                <div class="fans_text">The math is against us. This team only has two legitimate NBA starters amongst the 5 needed to compete/win games against top teams. And those two starters have missed 17 and 22 games each, In the 1st half of a season. This is now a trend, not an anomaly.</div>

                <div class="fans_text">When any player plays as awful as Russ has and then calls out the coach for not playing him, the player is the problem. When your team closes a huge gap in the fourth when you’re on the bench how do you blame the coach? The eye test says he’s playing the guys who have the best opportunity to win. Russ’ comments last night sure sound an awful lot like Melo in OKC and Houston before he understood his role. Maybe its time for Russ to be talking with Melo and not Bron and AD.</div>

Russ is here 6 months and feels he has the cachet to be able to do it. Wtf. Essentially he's calling for the coach to be fired. He sees himself as a leader of the team. Tge coach should be removed because Russ fails to play defense and isn't disciplined enough to remember the scouting report and follow the defensive game plan. You cannot make this shit up.</div>
